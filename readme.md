[ROS-Industrial][] Fanuc meta-package. See the [ROS wiki][] page for more information.

The [fanuc_experimental][] repository contains additional packages.


## Contents

Branch naming follows the ROS distribution they are compatible with. `-devel` branches may be unstable. Releases are made from the distribution branches (`hydro`, `indigo`, `kinetic`).

Older releases may be found in the Github mirror of the old ROS-Industrial [subversion repository][].

### MoveIt configurations

All provided MoveIt configurations were moved to the [moveit_cfgs](/moveit_cfgs) subdirectory in [#322][].
These packages can be used as-if they were still located in the root of the repository.
Catkin will still be able to locate them.


## Status

The packages in this repository are *community supported*.
This means they do not get support from the OEM, nor from the ROS-Industrial consortia directly (see also the `support level` badge at the top of this page).

Maintenance and development is on a best-effort basis and depends on volunteers.

FANUC does not support ROS.


## Installation

Binary packages are available for ROS Kinetic, but not all packages have been released.

For installation on newer ROS versions, refer to the *Building* section below.

The following packages have been released (as of 2019-10-09):

 - `fanuc_driver`
 - `fanuc_resources`
 - all support packages (ie: `fanuc_*_support`)

They can be installed using `apt` (on Ubuntu and Debian).

The other packages (MoveIt configurations and plugins) can be built from sources (see the *Building* section below).

### Example

To install `fanuc_m10ia_support` on Ubuntu Xenial for ROS Kinetic (after having followed the normal ROS Kinetic installation tutorial):

```
sudo apt install ros-kinetic-fanuc-m10ia-support
```

This would install `ros-kinetic-fanuc-resources` and `ros-kinetic-fanuc-driver` as well (and all their dependencies).


## Building

### On newer (or older) versions of ROS

Building the packages on newer (or older) versions of ROS is in most cases possible and supported. For example: building the packages in this repository on Ubuntu Bionic/ROS Melodic or Ubuntu Focal/ROS Noetic systems is supported. This will require creating a Catkin workspace, cloning this repository, installing all required dependencies and finally building the workspace.

### Catkin tools

It is recommended to use [catkin_tools][] instead of the default [catkin][] when building ROS workspaces. `catkin_tools` provides a number of benefits over regular `catkin_make` and will be used in the instructions below. All packages can be built using `catkin_make` however: use `catkin_make` in place of `catkin build` where appropriate.

### Building the packages

The following instructions assume that a [Catkin workspace][] has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and that the *source space* is at `$HOME/catkin_ws/src`. Update paths appropriately if they are different on the build machine.

These instructions build the `melodic-devel` branch on a ROS Melodic system:

```bash
# change to the root of the Catkin workspace
$ cd $HOME/catkin_ws

# retrieve the latest development version of fanuc. If you'd rather
# use the latest released version, replace 'melodic-devel' with 'kinetic'
# NOTE: 'melodic-devel' is compatible with ROS Noetic. 'kinetic' may not be
$ git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc.git src/fanuc

# check build dependencies. Note: this may install additional packages,
# depending on the software installed on the machine
$ rosdep update

# be sure to change 'melodic' to whichever ROS release you are using
$ rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic

# build the workspace (using catkin_tools)
$ catkin build
```

### Activating the workspace

Finally, activate the workspace to get access to the packages just built:

```bash
$ source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

At this point all packages should be usable (ie: `roslaunch` should be able to auto-complete package names starting with `fanuc_..`). In case the workspace contains additional packages (ie: not from this repository), those should also still be available.


## Installation and usage

Refer to [Working With ROS-Industrial Robot Support Packages][] for information on how to use the files provided by the robot support and MoveIt configuration packages. See also the other pages on the [ROS wiki][].

Refer to the [tutorials][] for information on installation and configuration of the controller-specific software components.
